# How it works

The core of the code is pretty simple.

- It's a React app with sliders made with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev).
- The fancy math is done with [JSCad libraries](https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org).
- Sliders modify a small data model of the box.
- When model changes it calls box_to_solids() to produce JSCad geometry solids.
- [jscad-react](https://github.com/kenianbei/jscad-react) does the interactive 3D rendering (presumably with ThreeJS underneath).
- export_stl() uses a [JSCad serializer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jscad/stl-serializer) to generate the STL as a binary blob
- force download the blob as box.stl.
